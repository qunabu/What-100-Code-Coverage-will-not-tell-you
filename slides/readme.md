# Happy Path

In the context of software or information modeling, a **happy path** (sometimes called happy flow) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.

---

# Coverage reports are easy to trick

---

# Edge cases

An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.

---

## 100% coverage doesn't mean everything is working as it should

---

# Tests can be misleading

This is especially true if you write tests after you've already written the code. You might find a method that hasn't been tested properly, so you write a test for it.

# Defensive programming

Defensive programming is a form of defensive design intended to develop programs that are capable of detecting potential security abnormalities and make predetermined responses. It ensures the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances.

# Code smells

— What? How can code "smell"??

— Well it doesn't have a nose... but it definitely can stink!
